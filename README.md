Console-based student management system in Java with MySQL:

Overview
A console-based Student Management System built with Java (backend) and MySQL (database). This project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and database integration to manage student records efficiently.

Features
Add, update, delete, and view student records
Structured relational database using MySQL
Backend integration with Java via JDBC
Error handling for invalid inputs and database operations
Modular design using OOP principles (classes, objects, methods)

Tech Stack
Java (Core & OOP concepts)
MySQL for database
JDBC for Java-database connection

Purpose
This project showcases my ability to design and implement a Java application with a relational database, applying CRUD operations and OOP principles. It demonstrates practical experience in backend development and connecting applications with databases for real-world data management.
